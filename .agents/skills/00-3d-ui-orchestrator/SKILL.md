# 3D UI Design Orchestrator

## Language Protocol
- Respond in Vietnamese. Restate non-English requests in English first.
- Internal analysis in English; final response in Vietnamese.

## Trigger
Activates when the user requests 3D user interface design, spatial interaction architecture, diegetic in-game interface design, Web3D configurator UI, or XR/VR/AR interface engineering, compiling into a structured `3d_system_design.md`.

Skip for traditional 2D flat web/app designs without spatial, 3D mesh, or world-space interaction requirements.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Spatial Medium & Interaction Classification
**Objective**: Determine the 3D application medium, rendering engine, viewing hardware, and input modalities before routing.

1. Classify the product medium: Web3D (Three.js/Babylon/R3F), 3D Game (PC/Console/Mobile), XR/Spatial Computing (VisionOS/Quest), or Industrial Digital Twin.
2. Establish the primary input mechanics: Mouse Raycast, Touch Drag, 6DoF VR Controllers, Hand Tracking (Gaze & Pinch), or Gamepad D-pad.
3. Identify spatial viewing boundaries: Field of View (FoV), comfort depth zones (0.5m - 2.0m), and stereoscopic considerations.

### Phase 2: Specialist Routing & Execution
**Objective**: Construct an execution plan and dispatch tasks to specialized 3D skills per `references/3d-workflow-routes.md`.

1. Route to `01-3d-spatial-ux-architecture` to classify interface elements (Diegetic, Non-diegetic, Spatial, Meta) and ergonomics.
2. Route to `02-3d-design-system-materials` to define 3D spatial tokens, unlit/PBR materials, spatial audio, and 3D component states.
3. Route to `03-3d-platform-engine-recipes` for engine-specific architecture (Three.js, Unity World Canvas, Unreal UMG 3D, VisionOS).
4. Route to `04-3d-spatial-qa-optimization` to audit draw calls, transparent overdraw, vergence comfort, and cyber sickness risks.

### Phase 3: Spatial Specification Synthesis
**Objective**: Consolidate spatial design decisions into `docs/3d-ui-design/3d_system_design.md` following `references/3d_system_design_spec.md`.

1. Aggregate technical specifications: spatial coordinates, shader models, billboarding constraints, and performance budgets.
2. Validate cross-system coherence: Ensure 3D components meet engine draw-call budgets and remain fully legible under arbitrary 3D scene lighting.
3. Deliver the finalized specification for implementation by technical artists, game developers, or frontend engineers.

## Output Format
Unified 3D design specification file at `docs/3d-ui-design/3d_system_design.md` covering:
1. 3D Context & Hardware Bounds
2. 4-Tier UI Classification (Diegetic, Non-Diegetic, Spatial, Meta)
3. 3D Tokens, Materials & Shaders (Unlit/PBR, SDF Text, Spatial Audio)
4. 3D Component Specifications (Proximity, Raycast, Physics feedback)
5. Engine Integration Recipes (Web3D, Unity, Unreal, XR)
6. Spatial Performance & Comfort Sign-off

## Don'ts
- Do not apply flat 2D pixel coordinates to 3D world space; define metric scale (1 unit = 1 meter) and depth layers.
- Do not use lit PBR shaders for critical text that becomes unreadable in dark game/virtual environments; specify unlit/emissive models.
- Do not bypass `04-3d-spatial-qa-optimization` before delivering the final specification.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] 3D application medium and input modalities explicitly classified
- [ ] Interface elements categorized across Diegetic, Non-diegetic, Spatial, and Meta classes
- [ ] Comfort depth planes (Near, Comfort, Far) and FoV angles defined
- [ ] Text rendering specifies SDF / MSDF billboarding techniques
- [ ] All interactive 3D components specify hover/proximity, raycast focus, and actuation feedback
- [ ] Draw call and transparent overdraw budgets established for target hardware
